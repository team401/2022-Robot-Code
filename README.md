# 2022-Robot-Code
Planning to publicise this repo soon. For those trying to figure out the commit history and branch structure, it goes something like this:

* Branch 'Swerve Test': Original branch for programming the swerve drive with Falcon 500's. Some of the code is... iffy.
* Branch 'main': First fully-functional code for this robot. Only goes up to our first comp in early March.
* Branch 'Advantage-Scope-Logged': We then had some help from an alumnus/mentor. Almost all code was rewritten in a separate repo using Mechanical Advantage's logging framework. Also implimented odometry pose estimation and vision circle-fitting for the turret. This branch includes the versions of our code used at CHS District Champs and worlds.
* Branch 'master': AdvantageKit turned out to have some performance concerns, and most of our programmers found it hard to understand, so the logger was removed and the code structure simplified.
